     <h2> Closure </h2>
     Hey darling
     I've come to say goodbye
     Guess this is the last time we'd meet
     We might cross path
     But it will only be normal if you don't        remember me
      I won't be around to take care of you
      Hold you tight
      Or laugh with you 
      But deep down I really hope you'll be fine

      I know I promised to stay forever
       But somethings weren't meant to be
       Take care darling
       I love you.
